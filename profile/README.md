# How to Open Science

[![OSF][badge]][osf]

'How to Open Science'[^disclaimer] is an alias used to easily identify research related to the advancement of open science, reproducibility, and replicability in disciplines. The goal of this group is to gather and inform others on research conducted on open science, promote practices and more robust metrics for reproducibility and replicability, and to analyze the current state of disciplines in adoption of these practices.

Currently, this group is focused on these goals in the following disciplines and conferences:

* Education Technology and Learning Sciences
    * [International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge][lak]
    * [International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education][aied]
    * [International Conference on Educational Data Mining][edm]
    * [ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale][lats]
